About the Project:

The main task in this project was to design a complete frontend with a little backend for a simple C like compiler. The project was sectioned with several parts named "Khans".

Khan 1: PreProcessing
Khan 2: Lexical Analysis
Khan 3: Pasrsing
Khan 4: Semantic Analysis
Khan 5: Intermediate Code Generation
Khan 6: Optimization
Khan 7: Code Generation
We had been only provided with a sample input/output for each parts. And we had to design DFAs, Grammers, Attributes and everythig else by ourselfs.

TeamWork:

We didn't spilit the project between ourselfs and we went through each section together. We disscused and talked about diffrent ideas to how to do the tasks needed. We spent most of our time on searching, learning and designing the things needed. And we couldn't implement many of them. But we have uploaded the documnets of our brainstorms meetings. We had done the fist two Khans of the project. And we have a design for the Third part. But although we spent enough amount of time for the others Khans, we didn't know howe to design and how to code them. And also we didn't have enough time for this challanging project!
